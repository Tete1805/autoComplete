# autoComplete

 Simple plain JS autocomplete for inputs.

## Usage

```html
<link href="autocomplete.css"></link>
<script src="autocomplete.js"></script>
<input my-autocomplete='{ "list": ["Item1", "Item2", "Item3"], "maxItems": 20, "markItems": true }' placeholder="Try typing here"/>
```

## Features

  - Simple
  - CSS Hackable
  - Can highlight matching letters
  - Can limit the number of results
  - Relatively fast

## Notes

This was done as a project / personnal challenge.

This is clearly aimed at server rendered pages, no AJAX capabilities and I'm not gonna add it. 

(Maybe in a different project though.)

No tests are available at the moment.

May have some quirks. :smile:
